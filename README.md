# Welcome to my battleships game!

This battleships game is playable in the terminal and involves a player vs the computer battle! The player will try and guess the location of the computer’s battleship. The player will only have a set number of choices to find and destroy the battleship. If they player runs out of turns then it is game over… if they player finds the ship before running out of turns the they will win!

# How to play:
* The first thing you will see is an introductory message “Let’s play battleships!”. it will also display “you have 5 guesses to find the ship”. Then you will see the battle ships board a five-by-five grid with “~” displaying as the ocean. Just underneath will be your turn count.

* You will then see an option to guess a row, shortly after you will be asked to guess a column. Once you have guessed you will see one of three messages: “that’s not even on the board!”, “congratulations you have sank my ship”, “ha-ha, you missed my battleship”. 

* You will then see the five-by-five grid once again but this time a symbol showing ether a hit “!” or a miss “?”. If the coordinates you put in wasn’t even on the board, you will see the board displaying only the ocean. If you missed, then you turn count will increase. 
This will be repeated untill you have ether destroyed the ship or have run out of turns!
